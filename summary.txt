A threshold Public Goods Game (PGG) in which success requires overall cooperative collective action, and decisions
must be made knowing that failure to cooperate implies a risk of overall collapse

This is a first summary text from a first read of the article

Population (Z):
 -> Zr = rich individuals
 -> Zp = poor individuals
 -> Z = Zr + Zp
 -> N = size of the groups formed from individuals randomly sampled from the population

Endowment (b):
 -> br = money start for rich individuals
 -> bp = money start for poor individuals
 -> br > bp
 -> c = a fraction of the endowment (b) to help solve the group task

Behaviors:
 -> cooperators (Cs) = contribute c to help solve the group task
 -> defector (Ds) = do not contribute anything to solve the group task

If the next intermediate target is not met:
 -> Cs will lose: br/p - c
 -> Ds will lose: br/p
_
b is the average endowment of the population
  _
Mcb is the threshold to be met with the contributions (c)

r = perception of risk of collective disaster, probability of individuals to lose everything if the threshold is not met

Homophily (h):
 -> 0 ≤ h ≤ 1
 -> h = 1, individuals are restricted to influence (and be influenced) by those of the same wealth status
 -> h = 0, no wealth discrimination takes place

ηG = fraction of time a group succeeds in achieving Mcb as a function of risk

Payoff function (Π):
    -> jr = nbr of rich Cs in the group of size N
    -> jp = nbr of poor Cs in the group of size N
    -> nbr of Ds = N−jr−jp   _
    -> Δ = cr*jr + cp*jp − Mcb
    -> ΠDs(payoff for defectors) = b * {Θ(Δ) + (1-r) * [1− Θ(Δ)]}
    -> ΠCs(payoff for cooperators) = ΠDs - c
    -> Θ(Δ)=1 whenever Δ>1 being 0 otherwise

fitness (f) of an individual adopting a given strategy (X) in a population of wealth class (k) (fXk):
    -> supplementary material 4 different fitness functions

The number of individuals adopting a given strategy will evolve in time according to a stochastic
birth–death process combined with the pairwise comparison rule = each individual of strategy X adopts
the strategy Y of a randomly selected member of the population, with probability  given by the Fermi function


A mutation probability μ, individuals adopt a randomly chosen different strategy, in such a way that when
μ=1, the individual does change strategy

The transition probabilities T can all be written in terms of the following expression, which
gives the probability that an individual with strategy X ∈{R,P}; Dg in the subpopulation k ∈{C,D};
Pg changes to a different strategy Y ∈{C,D}; Dg, both from the same subpopulation k and from the
other population l (that is, l = P if k = R, and l = R if k = P)
    -> supplementary material to check the function

There is also a gradient of selection ∇i
